EXPENSE TRACKER APPLICATION

Developed an Expense Tracker Application to help users manage their personal expenses efficiently. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete expenses, categorize them (such as Food, Transport, Entertainment), and visualize their spending. The goal was to create a simple yet functional web-based application that could be easily deployed and scaled."

Technologies Used:
"The project was built using the following technologies:
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interactions.
* Deployment: The frontend is hosted on Netlify.

Key Features:
1. CRUD Operations:
    * "The app performs full CRUD operations. Users can create new expense entries, read/view all their expenses, update existing entries, and delete expenses they no longer need."
2. Category Management:
    * "Each expense is tagged with a category (like Food, Transport, etc.), allowing users to filter and organize their spending."
  
Future Improvements:
"In the future, I would like to add more features such as data visualization with charts, user authentication for personalized expense tracking, add backend technology to store it in database and a reporting feature to analyze spending trends over time."
